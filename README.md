### Data Ingestion and Storage:

- **Efficient Extraction**: Specialized scripts extract essential data from diverse sources, ensuring the retrieval of pertinent information.
- **Centralized Storage**: Extracted data is stored in the Data Lake, forming a centralized repository for raw datasets, including combined, population, and EVB datasets.

### Data Processing and Transformation:

- **Quality Assurance**: Processing and transformation scripts ensure data quality, consistency, and relevance, enhancing the usability of datasets.
- **Structured Storage**: Processed datasets are organized and stored in the Data Warehouse section of the S3 bucket, ready for analysis, with optimal structuring for querying.

### Orchestration with Dockerized Airflow:

- **Seamless Workflow**: Dockerized Apache Airflow orchestrates the ETL pipeline, guaranteeing the smooth execution of loading and processing tasks.
- **Reliability and Scalability**: Airflow within EC2 ensures reliability and scalability, managing workflows efficiently.

### Data Warehouse:

- **Transformed Data Repository**: The Data Warehouse holds curated and transformed datasets, facilitating easy integration with analytical tools.
- **S3 Flexibility**: S3's flexibility and scalability make it a preferred choice for storing structured and curated data.

### Streamlit Application Development:

- **Insightful Interface**: Leveraging transformed data, Streamlit application development allows an interactive platform for users to explore and visualize rural water quality insights.
- **Tab-specific Functionalities**: Each tab in the Streamlit app corresponds to specific functionalities, managed by dedicated Python scripts, offering focused insights.

### Integration and Accessibility:

- **Seamless Integration**: The RWQ-ETL process integrates data extraction, processing, and loading seamlessly, ensuring accuracy and accessibility.
- **Robust Architecture**: This architecture guarantees data accuracy, accessibility, and scalability throughout the ETL journey, promoting meaningful insights from curated water quality datasets.
